I am passionate about development; my first lines of code were written at university in 2006, and since then, I have fallen in love.

I entered the mobile world when I discovered Android. All my attention turned to this technology; that feeling of independence, of being able to create an application and publish it to the world was the key factor.

Regarding cross-platform technologies, after spending a few years with React Native, I discovered this little gem called Flutter for its rapid development and cross-platform support. Now it's also one of my favorite technologies.

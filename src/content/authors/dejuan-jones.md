<h2>How I Started</h2>

<p>Everyone has to start somewhere. Since I did not understand marketing or how to begin, I wanted a simple explanation. I wanted to find a proven system that explained marketing and how to earn money through the internet.</p>

<p>I knew that there were two ways that average people were becoming millionaires. The first way was real estate. With real estate, it takes money to make money. If you don’t have a lump sum of money, you’ll need good credit. I had neither of these commodities.</p>

<p>After endless days and nights of frustration, I found a website called PPC. The site said I could make money every time someone visited my website. All I needed to pay for was a domain name and a hosting plan. There was something about this site that alerted me it would be a breakthrough.</p>

<p>Initially I start searching for internet opportunities in the summer of 2004. At first, I was nervous and skeptical. However, after research I realized this was legit, I joined in and essentially took my first step towards financial freedom.</p>

<p>Upon further investigation, I continuously came across websites that displayed "opportunities to make money online free". However, every time I visited these sites, I always found a fee attached after I went through the sign-up process. Of course, these websites kept the fees concealed until the end.</p>

<h3>My First Website</h3>

<p>In 2008, I started my first website and named it freelegitmoney.com. I wanted to show my readers free legitimate online opportunities, unlike the misleading information I discovered. I dug in to find all the free opportunities to make money online, then displayed all these opportunities on my site. In the beginning, I used ads and other affiliate programs to earn profits.</p>

<p>It took a few years to get it functioning well. Honestly, I was earning a few hundred per month in the second year. In the third year, I earned around $800 U.S. a month in ads alone. I have been earning revenue online for over a decade.</p>

<h3>How to Earn Money Online?</h3>

<p>On the journey to start earning money online, where does one begin? As you may already know, you must learn how to earn money online. There's always a right way and a wrong way to do things. Pursuing online opportunities is just like job hunting, but extends to more details. Job hunting consist of actively pursuing jobs in which you're qualified, i.e., tasks you; have done in the past, possess a college degree, have a certificate. Whereas, pursuing online opportunities correctly, extends to searching for niche related opportunities.</p>
